      <description>This project arises from an idea I had when I saw how people still use paper to register appointments and usually do not keep track of it.
So I decided to implement a system in which there are administrator users and clients. Clients can schedule a single new appointment or for several clients that require the use of a service by selecting the date in a calendar and after selecting the date you can also select a service that The company offers for a specific time and depending on the appointments you want to register you can select the service for each registration, the system will calculate the time that the service will last for each registration.</description>
